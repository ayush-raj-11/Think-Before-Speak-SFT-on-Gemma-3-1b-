Each example contains:\n\n- **Reasoning / Explanation**  \n  A detailed, step-by-step thought process that demonstrates **how to approach and solve the problem**.  \n\n- **Final Answer**  \n  A concise and correct answer used for evaluation and reward calculation.  \n\nThis method ensures the model **learns how to think, not just what to answer**, making its outputs more interpretable and trustworthy.\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- Custom reward functions can be added to reinforce **correct reasoning patterns** and **concise answers**.  \n- Optimizer and scheduler choices are tailored for **JAX and TPU performance**, ensuring efficient convergence during training.  \n- Tokenization is handled with a **local tokenizer** to avoid internet dependencies and ensure reproducibility in offline environments.  \n\nBy combining **structured examples, supervised fine-tuning, and TPU acceleration**, this pipeline builds a model that is both **accurate and explainable**, meeting the key goals of the hackathon.\n\n---\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## Project Overview: Reasoning-Capable LLM with Tunix & Gemma-3-1B\n\nThis project demonstrates a **structured approach to training language models that reason step-by-step**, using Tunix and Gemma-3-1B. The model provides answers along with **clear explanations of its reasoning**.\n\n---\n\n### Why Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n\nSFT establishes a strong reasoning foundation by directly training the model on high-quality stepwise traces.\n\n**Benefits:**  \n- Stable and predictable training  \n- Easy to evaluate and reproduce  \n- Encourages the model to internalize reasoning patterns rather than rely on reward hacks  \n\n> Insight: Reinforcement learning cannot compensate for weak reasoning foundations — reasoning must be explicitly taught first.\n\n---\n\n### Why Not GRPO / Reinforcement Learning\n\nWhile GRPO is powerful, it was not used initially because:  \n- Designing effective reward functions is complex  \n- High risk of reward hacking  \n- Training instability on small-scale (1B) models  \n- Computationally expensive  \n\n> Best practice: Build a strong reasoning foundation via SFT first, then refine with RL if needed.\n\n---\n\n### Why Not LoRA\n\nLoRA is excellent for low-resource or fast adaptation, but for deep reasoning:  \n- Patterns span multiple layers  \n- LoRA limits structural changes in the model  \n- Full SFT ensures better alignment across the network  \n\n> Focus: Depth and reasoning quality over rapid adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Why Gemma-3-1B\n\n- JAX-native → native Tunix support and TPU optimization  \n- TPU-efficient → fast iteration and scaling  \n- Balanced size → manageable for experimentation yet capable of complex reasoning  \n\nGemma-3-1B is ideal for **transparent, high-quality reasoning research**.\n\n---\n\n### Project Deliverables\n\n- Complete **Tunix-based training pipeline**  \n- Reproducible **configurations and datasets**  \n- Fine-tuned model that produces **structured reasoning and answers**  \n- Framework for **explainable and interpretable LLM behavior**\n\n---\n\n### Future Extensions\n\n- Add GRPO/RL to refine reasoning outputs  \n- Multi-task reasoning datasets for broader generalization  \n- Hybrid SFT + RL pipelines for improved performance  \n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n> This project demonstrates Supervised Fine-Tuning with Tunix on Gemma-3-1B to create a transparent, reproducible reasoning model that can explain its step-by-step thought process, not just the final answer.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Cell 0: 🔧 Environment & Backend Setup (JAX +

`<answer>` tags are parsed to get predicted numeric answers.\n  - Ground-truth answers are extracted from `####` delimiters.\n  - Reasoning traces are stored separately for analysis.\n- **Normalization** ensures fair comparison (removes symbols, commas, case differences).\n- **Inference settings**:\n  - `temperature=0.1` → Low randomness to make model output **deterministic**, which is critical for math problems.\n  - `top_k=3` → Small decoding diversity to **prevent model from hallucinating** and ensure safe, reliable reasoning.\n- Accuracy is calculated as the fraction of exact numeric matches.\n- Average time per question is logged to monitor TPU performance.\n- Any failed cases are stored with reasoning for **debugging and inspection**.\n\nThis setup ensures **robust and reproducible evaluation**, emphasizing numeric correctness while keeping reasoning traces intact.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Helper function to extract answer from GSM8K format\ndef extract_hash_answer(text):\n    \"\"\"Extract numerical answer after #### delimiter.\"\"\"\n    if \"####\" not in text:\n        return None\n    return text.split(\"####\")[1].strip()\n\n# Helper function to extract reasoning from GSM8K format\ndef extract_reasoning(text):\n    \"\"\"Extract reasoning (everything before #### delimiter).\"\"\"\n    if \"####\" not in text:\n        return text.strip()\n    return text.split(\"####\")[0].strip()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-08T14:56:54.478334Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-08T14:56:54.478567Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-08T14:56:54.483113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-08T14:56:54.478549Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-08T14:56:54.481945Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\nimport time\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\n\nMAX_GEN_STEPS = 512\nTEMPERATURE = 0.1\nTOP_K = 3  # small diversity, safe for reasoning\n\nprint(\"=\" * 60)\nprint(\"Running Evaluation (Numeric Answer Only, Reasoning Stored)\")\nprint(\"=\" * 60)\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Helper functions\n# ----------------------------\ndef extract_hash_answer(text):\n    \"\"\"Extract numerical answer after #### delimiter.\"\"\"\n    if \"####\" not in text:\n        return None\n    return text.split(\"####\")[1].strip()\n\ndef extract_reasoning(text):\n    \"\"\"Extract reasoning (everything before #### delimiter).\"\"\"\n    if \"####\" not in text:\n        return text.strip()\n    return text.split(\"####\")[0].strip()\n\ndef extract_answer_from_model(response_text):\n    \"\"\"Extract numeric answer from model <answer> tag.\"\"\"\n    match = re.search(r\"<answer>\\s*(.*?)\\s*</answer>\", response_text, re.DOTALL)\n    if match:\n        return match.group(1).strip()\n    return None\n\ndef normalize_answer(ans):\n    \"\"\"Normalize answer string for numeric comparison.\"\"\"\n    if ans is None:\n        return None\n    ans = str(ans).strip().lower()\n    ans = ans.replace(\",\", \"\").replace(\"$\", \"\")\n    return ans\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Evaluation loop\n# ----------------------------\ncorrect = 0\ntotal = len(test_dataset)\nfailures = []\n\nstart_time = time.time()\n\nfor i in tqdm(range(total), desc=\"Evaluating\"):\n    example = test_dataset.iloc[i]  # Use pandas DataFrame indexing\n\n    # Extract GT numeric answer\n    gt_answer_raw = extract_hash_answer(example[\"answer\"])\n    gt_answer = normalize_answer(gt_answer_raw)\n\n    # Build prompt\n    prompt = build_prompt(example[\"question\"])\n\n    # Run model\n    output = text_generator(\n        input_strings=[prompt],\n        max_generation_steps=MAX_GEN_STEPS,\n        temperature=TEMPERATURE,\n        top_k=TOP_K\n    )\n\n    response = output.text[0]\n    if \"<end_of_turn>\" in response:\n        response = response.split(\"<end_of_turn>\")[0]\n\n    # Extract predicted numeric answer\n    pred_raw = extract_answer_from_model(response)\n    pred_norm = normalize_answer(pred_raw)\n\n    # Extract reasoning for inspection\n    reasoning = extract_reasoning(response)\n\n    # Check correctness\n    if pred_norm == gt_answer:\n        correct += 1\n    else:\n        failures.append({\n            \"question\": example[\"question\"],\n            \"gt\": gt_answer,\n            \"pred\": pred_norm,\n            \"reasoning\": reasoning\n        })\n\nend_time = time.time()\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Results\n# ----------------------------\naccuracy = 100 * correct / total\navg_time = (end_time -
